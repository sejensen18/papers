# About

This is a place for keeping papers that I plan to read or have read. Papers are downloaded from their online source using the following example command:

`wget -U 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070802 SeaMonkey/1.1.4' https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05983.pdf`

The papers are intentionally left with an ambiguous title. This encourages random reading and broad exposure to new subjects. The `toread` folder is mostly for important papers that should be read at a later date. The root folder is for random papers that are encountered. The `complete` folder is for papers that are complete. Within the folder, papers are categorized into subfolders.
